What is sqpl?
-------------

sqpl is a program for running SQL queries against a Sybase database. It 
works in one of two modes:

* If it is passed some SQL either on the command line, from
  STDIN or in a file it will run that SQL against the database
  and write the results to STDOUT.

* If no SQL is found, it will go into an interactive moden (a bit like 
  isql - but better!)


Features of sqpl
----------------

* Choice of output formats:
  + standard isql-style
  + box mode (like mysql)
  + CSV mode

* Choice of DBI/DBD::Sybase or Sybase::CTlib versions.

* Connection paramters configured using environment variables or command
  line parameters.

* Switch off header and footer information.

* Use your favourite text editor to edit SQL queries.


Differences from isql
---------------------

* Uses ';' instead of 'go' to terminate SQL queries.

* Uses 'edit' instead of 'vi' to edit queries.

* Uses 'quit' instead of 'exit' to finish a session.


Using sqpl
----------

Usage: sqpl [-S server] [-U user] [-P password] [-D database]
            [-f SQL file] [more SQL] [< yet more SQL]
            [-H] [-F] [-v] [-h] [-b] [-c]

where: 'server'       is the name of a valid database server 
                      (uses \$DSQUERY by default)
       'user'         is a valid username on that server 
                      (uses \$DBUSER by default)
       'password'     is the user\'s password (uses \$DBPASS by default)
       'database'     is a valid database on the server 
                      (uses user\'s default DB by default!)
       'SQL file'     is a file containing SQL statements to execute
       'more SQL'     is SQL passed on the command line
       'yet more SQL' is SQL passed in through STDIN

       '-H' displays the results without column headers
       '-F' displays the results without footer information 
            (i.e. rows returned and stored proc return status)
       '-b' displays results in a 'box' format (a bit like MySQL)
       '-c' displays results in a CSV format
       '-v' displays version and copywrite information
       '-h' displays help

SQL statements are executed in the order:

1/ Command line SQL
2/ SQL file 
3/ SQL from STDIN

You can miss any of them out. If you miss out all three, you\'ll be put
into an interactive SQL session - a bit like isql.

When entering SQL on the command line you should remember that certain
characters (e.g. '*') are interpreted by the shell before the program
sees them, so it might be useful to put all SQL within single quotes.

Having entered a statement you can edit it by typing 'edit' at the 
prompt. The editor used is determined by the value in the $EDITOR or
$VISUAL enviroment variable (vi is used by default).
