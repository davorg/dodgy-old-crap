                   -----------------------------

ms-guest.pl is a simple guest-book script for World Wide Web pages.
It allows visitors to a page to write comments which are stored 
along with their name and email address. These comments can then be 
viewed by later visitors to the same page.



AVAILABILITY

The latest version of ms-guest should always be available from:

     http://www.mag-sol.com/Download.shtml


PREREQUISITES

In order to install and use this script you will need Perl version
5.002 or better.  This package also depends on packages that are 
distributed separately from perl.  We recommend that you have
the following packages installed before you install ms-guest:

  CGI            (bundled with perl5.004 and better)
  FreezeThaw

These packages should be available on CPAN (the Comprehensive
Perl Archive Network) and your nearest CPAN mirror can be found
at www.perl.com.



INSTALLATION

ms-guest is distributed as a gzipped tar file. To extract the files
from the archive type the following commands:

    gunzip ms-guest.tar.gz
    tar xvf ms-guest.tar

You will end up with three files called README (this file), COPYING
and ms-guest.pl.

Installation of ms-guest is as simple as copying the file ms-guest.pl
into the cgi directory of your web server. This directory may be called
cgi or cgi-bin or perhaps something completely different. If in doubt
ask the person responsible for running your web server.



USAGE

ms-guest can be used in two modes. In the simple mode you just insert 
a call to the cgi script in your HTML page. This might look something
like this:

<P>Please sign our <A HREF="/cgi/ms-guest.pl">Guest Book</A>.</P>

ms-guest will then generate a default guest book page. To see what 
this looks like try entering the URL

http://www.mag-sol.com/cgi/ms-guest.pl

in your browser.

If you want to maintain more than one guest book on a site you can 
pass a file parameter to the script. The default file name is 'guest'. 
A site that had two guest books might (just) have this HTML fragment 
on it:

<P>Please sign our <A HREF="/cgi/ms-guest.pl?file=guest1">first</A>
or <A HREF="/cgi/ms-guest.pl?gile=guest2">second</A> guest books.</P>

ms-guest takes one other parameter which is a template file name. This
allows you to customise your guest book page to look however you like.

A template is a normal HTML file that contains two special tags, 
'!!FORM!!' is inserted where you want the form for entering comments 
and '!!COMMENTS!!' is inserted where you want the comments displayed. 
A link to one of these pages would look something like this: 

<P>Please sign our 
<A HREF="/cgi/ms-guest.pl?file=guest1&template=guest.html">guest 
book</A>.</P>

An example of this usage can be seen in the guest book link on the 
Magnum Solutions main page at:

    http://www.mag-sol.com

and if you want to see what the page looks like before the tags
are replaced by the cgi scripts, take a look at:

    http://www.mag-sol.com/Guest.html

The default guest book page contains a copyright notice and a link
to the Magnum Solutions home page. I'd appreciate it if you would
do the same on any pages you create.

As of version 2.0, the ms-guest distribution also includes another
progrma called e-guest.pl which allows you to edit your guest book.
e-guest is passed the name of the guest book file, like this:

    http://www.mag-sol.com/cgi/e-guest.pl?file=sample

You should probably consider adding some sort of security on the 
eecution of this file!

Please let me know where you're using ms-guest so I can pop by and
have a look. I'll also keep you informed of new releases.
